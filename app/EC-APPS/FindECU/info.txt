Notes:
1. Tested on my e90 & daten32/39 only
2. Designed for DDE/DME, but it should work with other modules
3. Check i-stufe by youself
4. You can add/edit FA_eng.txt
5. W/o VIN you'll get all options (not exactly for your Production Code)
6. I can't promise 100% accuracy, 99.9% only :)
7. All at your own risk
